Before getting started on analyzing data, we need to install the software we will use to analyze our data. We use the [R Software Environment](https://cran.r-project.org/) i

```{r, echo = FALSE}
    xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
    url = '../../presentations/Software_Preparations.html',
    ratio = "4:3",
    max_width = 800
    )
```
